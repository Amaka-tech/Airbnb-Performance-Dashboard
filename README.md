## Project Overview

This project visualizes the performance of Airbnb listings using Tableau. It aims to uncover pricing patterns, occupancy trends, and geographic distributions that can inform business strategy for hosts and platform managers.

---

## Problem Statement ‚ùì

With the increasing competition in the short-term rental market, Airbnb hosts and analysts need a clear understanding of what drives performance‚Äîsuch as optimal pricing, location-based demand, and property features. The project addresses how these factors influence booking success and revenue generation.

## Data Source and Transformation üóÇÔ∏è

**Dataset:** The dataset [here](Tableau_Full_Project_Github.xlsx) contains the Airbnb listing data including location, pricing, property type, availability, and review metrics.

**Data Preparation:**

  - Cleaned and structured in Excel to remove duplicates, handle nulls, and standardize formats.

  - Loaded into Tableau for visual analysis. File attached [here](7.Airbnb_Tableau_Project.twb).

  - Created calculated fields and hierarchies for filtering and drill-down insights.
